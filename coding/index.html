    <p> Through years of school classes and summer camps, I have gained proficiency in using the languages Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, and Swift. <br>
        Along with this website, here are some of my favorite projects! </p>

                    <h3> Time Capsule </h3>
                    <h4> (December 2023) </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Placed first in best project for the hackathon. </li>
                        <li> The theme of the hackathon was: "Time." </li>
                        <li> Working with a partner, our goal was to develop a website designed for users to save their cherished memories to look back on in the future. </li>
                        <li> This website shows a demo of how the time capsule feature works, while the last capsule is locked with a countdown feature. </li>
                        <li> This project was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also used serverless functions with Cloudflare Workers to save and load the time capsules dynamically. </li>
                        <li> Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/noahkaboa/HackUC-4" target="_blank">Github </a> and <a href="https://devpost.com/software/time-capsule-mhn5ic" target="_blank">Devpost</a>! </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Given the task of recognizing a problem in society and designing a website to help resolve it, we designed this website to contribute to cultural appreciation. </li>
                        <li> Our motto is "be a traveler, not a tourist", which means to gain meaningful experiences during one's travels, rather than simply observing, taking, and appropriating. </li>
                        <li> This project features three cities we recommend to users, with various locations to explore during their stay. </li>
                        <li> This was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </li>

                        <li> The theme of the hackathon was: "Create your reality." </li>
                        <li> This website can act as a vision board for people aspiring to get involved in the field of computer science. </li>
                        <li> We placed a special emphasis on diversity, as we recognize that the field of computer science is especially intimidating for minorities; we want our site to be welcoming to all who are passionate about computer science. </li>
                        <li> Our project aims to encourage people to take charge of their own future and create their own reality, regardless of the gender and diversity gaps found in the field. </li>
